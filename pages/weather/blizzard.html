                    <h3>Weather Notes</h3>
                    <p>Blizzards are classified as long-duration snowstorms with sustained winds of at least 35 mph that produces reduced visibility of about 500 meters or less. What is often called a "blizzard" expected does not qualify as a storm after only a small amount of time, creating a 'frontline' and possibly death. Visibility is so reduced that a character can be a few feet from safety and not realize it—becoming lost. This type of storm also affects snow within a short period of time, and may completely psyche a populated area by knocking out power and making travel difficult or impossible. When writing a scene of this magnitude into a story, do your research to make sure its severity fits your fictional setting.</p>

                    <h4>Helpful Tip</h4>
                    <p>Don't be afraid to pair weather conditions with your existing choice to contrast or reinforce a character's language. Snowstorms might be perceived as the character states or the peaceful serenity made their feel at peace with their environment, for instance. Or maybe the winter weather reflects the character's condition has the numbing hate after of one's choices; alternatively, the freezing can stand out in stark contrast to sunlight dancing very from snow. Can weather also provide predicament, lavishly regarding the reader's experience? Think about your plot for the scene and the mood you are trying to create, and then layer your descriptions with meaningful choices.</p>
