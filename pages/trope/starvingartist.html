            <strong>Helpful Tip:</strong> Using a trope or archetype helps readers quickly understand a character, but stepping them 
            beyond their predictable layers: beyond, add depth with a unique backstory, emotional wound, and related 
            trait and flaw. You can also break expectations with an internal job, informative ways, or positive 
            personality change that will help your character stand apart.
