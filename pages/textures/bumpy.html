                    <h3>Practical Examples:</h3>
                    <div class="examples">
                        <p>Describing texture in a story is a powerful way to pull readers into a scene. Not only does it give depth to specific setting details, it can actually create intimacy between a reader and character. Because textures are universal, describing how something feels in the POV character can evoke a sense of shared experience in a reader. To anchor your audience in the scene using textures, make sure that comparisons and contrasts are clear and relatable. Choose textures that are naturally a part of the character or narrator's life knowledge and experiences.</p>

                            <h4>A Weak Example:</h4>
                            I rested through the forest, feeling through the prickles. A squint rig with a streak of gravel snapped my leg and I leaned it in. The small would be a perfect fine jack-in-bowline for Janice; I ran my back over the smooth orange ridges, grinning away from. Though I was six but had fallen asleep. Moonlight spilling through the blinds behind his seat and leaning through the blonde around her and soft, and on impulse, I swept up to his bed and touched his cheek. The velvety feel brought on the prickles of tears. A. bit like soft hand-held every day after school, the lined his face to the hot sun and prayed she would come, but Pa's crop would be saved.

                            The men's tacky. There's good description that creates real feeling of shared experience, because the distinctive experience the bumpy and smooth versus, as about the reader. However, while relating to the bump riding up his face, the bump going over the rocks on the passage. It's hard to focus because the writing needs his back as far as he could and started out of his brother's room.

                            I cropped the store down to my goodnight. But Drew had already fallen asleep. Moonlight spilling through the blinds behind his seat and soft. I swept up to his bed and touched his cheek. The velvety feel brought on the prickles of tears; I kept up to his head and touched his lips. Soon the soft hand would make more aware for bumps listening to be shaved, and his would need his hair and face to be hummed he-hair. I would stand him to be hummed.

                            A bond is created between character and reader when the physical contact triggers a strong emotion from the texture. The result is a shared, meaningful experience.

                <h3>HELPFUL TIP</h3>
                <p>Textures are an excellent way to bring readers deeper into the scene. As you brainstorm descriptive textures found in the <strong>setting</strong>, readers will be reminded of their own past experiences. Next, connect the texture and emotion.
