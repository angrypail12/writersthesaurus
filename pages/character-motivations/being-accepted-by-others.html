            <div class="section-title">Human Need Driving the Goal (Inner Motivation):</div>
            <div class="content-text">
                There are five basic human needs that, when missing from a character's life, could motivate them to pursue this goal. The following needs are all possibilities, but only one of them should be the primary driver for any given character. For more information on the relationship between human needs and outer motivations, please see this <a href="#" style="color: #2c5aa0;">Character Motivation tutorial</a>.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Self-Actualization:</strong> A character who is struggling to live one's truth in whatever form it comes in, such as wanting to live a life that follows certain spiritual beliefs, or embrace an identity in full, will be much easier if one can be accepted by others for one's core.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Esteem and Recognition:</strong> Self-esteem is often powered through a need to be liked. A desire for greater self-worth may push a character to find a place where they belong.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Love and Belonging:</strong> A character who feels unaccepted by family may be a motivation to seek acceptance by those very same people.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Safety and Security:</strong> In some situations, it can be different to stand out or be different than the crowd. If the character's safety was on the line (because of fear, racism, prejudicial thinking), they would seek to be accepted by a group may be one's only option for survival.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Physiological Needs:</strong> In the case of life or death, where number needs, being accepted by a group may be one's only option for survival.
