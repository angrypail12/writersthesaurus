            <div class="section-title">Human Need Driving the Goal (Inner Motivation):</div>
            <div class="content-text">
                There are five basic human needs that, when missing from a character's life, could motivate them to pursue this goal. The following needs are all possibilities, but only one of them should be the primary driver for any given character. For more information on the relationship between human needs and outer motivations, please see this <a href="#" style="color: #2c5aa0;">Character Motivation tutorial</a>.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Self-Actualization:</strong> A character wanting to live up to one's role may do so by going after a notorious individual. For instance, if a prestigious family or group was victimized while the community turned a blind eye, the character may pursue this goal out of a determination to achieve justice for them.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Esteem and Recognition:</strong> A character who was stripped of their accomplishments as a result of poor judgment or professional misconduct could view the chance to catch a criminal as a way of regaining the respect of their colleagues and community.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Safety and Security:</strong> A character whose loved one is in danger will do anything to capture the responsible person so the threat is neutralized.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Love and Belonging:</strong> If a character was in control danger, they would be driven to catch the bad guy.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Physiological Needs:</strong> If a character was in mortal danger, they might likely not hesitate to cause someone else pain to get what they need.
